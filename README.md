 - We can say there is no significant difference in time to run between 2018 & 2017 worksheet because we wre using same code.

### Performence Between original script & refacterd script
- When refactering the script I added 3 output arrays to represent
  - tickerVolume
  - tickerStartingPrice
  - tickerEndingPrice
 - And use those arrays to calculate volume,starting price and ending price for each ticker.
 - Below image shows the part of the coding which I added mainly to  refactered code.
